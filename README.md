These files are produced for a Master's Thesis in Strucutral Engineering. The thesis will be published later. 
### Application of Reclaimed Elements in Structural Engineering Towards Circular Economy 
The Master's Thesis is exploring application of reclaimed elements in structural engineering trough 3D modelling and AAD. 

#### 03 Workflow 
The files of the workflow developed in the thesis. The workflows aims to provide tools for creating a material bank and testing it using a matching algorithm. 

#### 04 Study Case 
The files of the study case developed in the thesis. The study case aims to test the application of the workflows.
